# Attendance Management Android App

This attendance management android app allows the students themselves to mark their attendance while in class (using session based attendance where students have to be on the same WIFI network as the teacher 
and the teacher has to start a session on his/her phone) and the app also keeps track of their overall attendance record. The app was created using JAVA in Android Studio IDE and the backend for the app was created with Django. 
The project also contains an admin panel in the form of a Web App using which they can register/de-register student and teachers, view all the attendance record and also assign and manage the classes and schedule of the students and teachers.
